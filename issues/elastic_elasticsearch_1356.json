The striping is simple, placing whole files in one of the locations, and deciding where to place the file based on the location with greatest free space. Note, there is no multiple copies of the same data, in that, its similar to RAID 0. Though simple, it should provide a good solution for people that don't want to mess with raids and the like. Here is how it is configured:\n\n```\n   path.data: /mnt/first,/mnt/second\n```\n\nOr the in an array format:\n\n```\n   path.data: [\"/mnt/first\", \"/mnt/second\"]\n```\n",
