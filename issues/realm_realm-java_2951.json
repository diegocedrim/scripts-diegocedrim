    "body": "When async queries are updated, they call listeners in a specific order. This currently has a very subtle bug, so accessing synchronous RealmResults from inside a async RealmResult listener might hit a detached row accessor.\n\nReason being is that the Realm is advanced, then all listeners called in order, but RealmResults are not synchronised until just before listener is called. This was discovered when investigating #2901, but I doubt it is the root cause.\n",
