Since string terms aggs\nare only used for text/keyword/string fields, they do not use the format and just\ncall toUt8String(). However when we support ipv6, ip addresses as well will be\nencoded in sorted doc values (just like strings) so we will need to use the\nDocValueFormat to format the keys.",
