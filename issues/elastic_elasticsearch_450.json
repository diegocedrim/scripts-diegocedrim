They still retain memory and \"fight\" with other caching structures for space.\n\nChange that by default, this filters will be weakly cached. They will be evicted first before other caching constructs (especially field cache).\n\nWhen using those filters with high chances of reuse (those filters will be constantly used by other queries), set `_cache` to `true` to enable more strong caching.\n",
