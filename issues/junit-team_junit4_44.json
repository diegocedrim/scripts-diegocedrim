    "body": "Right now the test names are named sequentially 0,1, etc in Parameterized:\n\n@Override\nprotected String getName() {\nreturn String.format(\"[%s]\", fParameterSetNumber);\n}\n\n@Override\nprotected String testName(final Method method) {\nreturn String.format(\"%s[%s]\", method.getName(), fParameterSetNumber);\n}\n\nIt would help if the data themselves were to be used in determining the name.  Proposed alternatives for name (which has to be determinited statically before Test is instantiated):\n- call toString on first parameter\n- call the a newly added names attribute to Parameters annotation (with default empty names for compatibility)\n  public String[] names() default {};\n- call a public, static (!) method annotated by newly-defined @TestName\n  and accepting the same arguments as the constructor\n\nI can provide (again) a patch.
