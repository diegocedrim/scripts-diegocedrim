    "body": "This PR simplifies the delayed shard allocation implementation by assigning clear responsibilities to the various components that are affected by delayed shard allocation:\n- `UnassignedInfo` gets a boolean flag `delayed` which determines whether assignment of the shard should be delayed. The flag gets persisted in the cluster state and is thus available across nodes, i.e. each node knows whether a shard was delayed-unassigned in a specific cluster state. Before, nodes other than the current master were unaware of that information.\n- This flag is initially set as `true` if the shard becomes unassigned due to a node leaving and the index setting `index.unassigned.node_left.delayed_timeout` being strictly positive. From then on, unassigned shards can only transition from delayed to non-delayed, never in the other direction.\n- The reroute step is in charge of removing the delay marker (comparing timestamp when node left to current timestamp). \n- A dedicated service `DelayedAllocationService`, reacting to cluster change events, has the responsibility to schedule reroutes to remove the delay marker.\n\nRelates to #18293\n",
