The update API is mostly useless with scripting turned off, and using the update API is necessary to scale our indexing.\r\n\r\nSo I think it would beneficial to individually configure which endpoints can accept scripts.",

        "body": "@gibrown thanks for the info.  These script settings also relate to the script source ie #7147, and sandboxed vs enabled vs disabled.\r\n\r\nFor instance, you may want to allow sandboxed dynamic scripting for updates, but only predefined indexed scripts for search (but without sandboxing). Wondering if we need to support general settings (for ease of use) and more specific settings (for flexible control).  There are also differences between scripting engines that make some safer than others, regardless of sandboxing. For instance, even though groovy is sandboxed, a simple `while (true) {}` will run forever.  Expressions, on the other hand, doesn't have loops and so doesn't suffer from that issue.\r\n\r\nThe settings need to cover the following combinations\r\n\r\n* mode:  enabled, disabled, sandboxed\r\n* source:  indexed, dynamic, file\r\n* engine: groovy, expressions, mustache, etc\r\n* operation: update, search, aggs\r\n\r\nI propose the following specific settings, which is what the code will use to decide whether to allow a script or not:\r\n\r\n    script.engine.groovy.indexed.update:    sandbox/enable/disable\r\n    script.engine.groovy.indexed.search:    sandbox/enable/disable\r\n    script.engine.groovy.indexed.aggs:      sandbox/enable/disable\r\n    script.engine.groovy.dynamic.update:    sandbox/enable/disable\r\n    script.engine.groovy.dynamic.search:    sandbox/enable/disable\r\n    script.engine.groovy.dynamic.aggs:      sandbox/enable/disable\r\n    script.engine.groovy.file.update:       sandbox/enable/disable\r\n    script.engine.groovy.file.search:       sandbox/enable/disable\r\n    script.engine.groovy.file.aggs:         sandbox/enable/disable\r\n\r\nFor ease of use, we should also support the following more generic settings:\r\n\r\n    script.all:     sandbox/enable/disable  (default: `sandbox`)\r\n\r\n    script.indexed: sandbox/enable/disable\r\n    script.dynamic: sandbox/enable/disable\r\n    script.file:    sandbox/enable/disable\r\n\r\n    script.update:  sandbox/enable/disable\r\n    script.search:  sandbox/enable/disable\r\n    script.aggs:    sandbox/enable/disable\r\n\r\nThese will be used to calculate the more specific settings, using the stricter setting of each combination, eg:\r\n\r\n    script.all:                             sandbox\r\n    script.dynamic:                         disable\r\n    script.search:                          disable\r\n    script.engine.groovy.file.search:       enable\r\n\r\nwill result in the following specific settings:\r\n\r\n    script.engine.groovy.indexed.update:    sandbox\r\n    script.engine.groovy.indexed.search:    disable\r\n    script.engine.groovy.indexed.aggs:      sandbox\r\n    script.engine.groovy.dynamic.update:    disable\r\n    script.engine.groovy.dynamic.search:    disable\r\n    script.engine.groovy.dynamic.aggs:      disable\r\n    script.engine.groovy.file.update:       sandbox\r\n    script.engine.groovy.file.search:       enable\r\n    script.engine.groovy.file.aggs:         sandbox\r\n\r\n\r\n",
