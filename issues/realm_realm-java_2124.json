    "body": "Closes #602 \nCloses #640 \nCloses #2051 \n\nThis PR changes the semantics of when RealmResults auto-refresh. In order to enable standard iterator behaviour we have to prevent the `size` of RealmResults to change automatically. This PR disables `sync_if_needed` for RealmResults in all cases, except when manually calling `Realm.refresh()` or receiving a change notification from another thread through the looper. It is specifically disabled when committing on the same thread.\n\nThis changes the semantics of RealmResults so there now is a chance it might contain deleted objects if one was deleted in the same looper event, but it will ensure that size() is stable for that duration as well.\n\nThis change is motivated by the fact that the first behaviour is much more common than relying on RealmResults _always_ being up to date.\n\nThe HandlerController has been refactored in the process as it was already keeping track of all RealmResults. Is is now also responsible for refreshing RealmResults when appropriate. \n\nTODO\n- [x] Refactor HandlerController to support explicit refresh.\n- [x] Create Iterator for RealmResults + unit tests.\n- [x] Create ListIterator for RealmResults + unit tests\n- [x] Create Iterator for RealmList + unit tests\n- [x] Create ListIterator for RealmList + unit tests\n- [x] Unit tests for the behaviour or refresh, especially with async results. \n- [x] Update website documentation\n- [x] Test aggregate methods on a RealmResult with removed results.\n- [x] https://github.com/realm/realm-core/issues/1509\n- [x] Blocked pending RealmCollection so the behaviour of `remove` is the same.\n",
