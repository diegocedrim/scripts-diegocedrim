    "body": "The fielddata settings in mappings have been refactored so that:\n- text and string have a `fielddata` (boolean) setting that tells whether it\n  is ok to load in-memory fielddata. It is true by default for now but the\n  plan is to make it default to false for text fields.\n- text and string have a `fielddata_frequency_filter` which contains the same\n  thing as `fielddata.filter.frequency` used to (but validated at parsing time\n  instead of being unchecked settings)\n- regex fielddata filtering is not supported anymore and will be dropped from\n  mappings automatically on upgrade.\n- text, string and _parent fields have an `eager_global_ordinals` (boolean)\n  setting that tells whether to load global ordinals eagerly on refresh.\n- in-memory fielddata is not supported on keyword fields anymore at all.\n- the `fielddata` setting is not supported on other fields that text and string\n  and will be dropped when upgrading if specified.\n",
