This changes the previous behavior of only using readers that were not warmed during merges, or already around. This change simplifies the warmer code significantly, and the overhead will be very small for existing warmed readers (like after a merge), yet allow us to implement warmers like the query cache (and actually have a cleaner contract, \"same as search\").\ncloses #7326",
