There's already override concept at the modules level so it is easy to understand what it means when applied to Provides binding (lower level).\r\nI would even risk saying that implementing default binding this way is a must - you just decided it when you invented overrides= in modules ;) You just need to enable it at the lower level.\r\n\r\nLast thing that I'm not 100% sure but that is obvious to my symmetry seeking brain is the fact that when we would have \r\noverrides= in <b>modues</b> and overridable= in <b>Providers</b>\r\nwe should also have\r\noverrides= in <b>Providers</b> and overridable= in <b>modules</b>\r\n\r\nNote a third option (which I don't like but mentioning for completeness of discussion).\r\nJust add overridable= to modules. It would be still possible to define default binding by placing it as only Provides method in overridable module. This seems awkward to me but avoids bringing override concept to Provides level - they would be only available in modules.",
