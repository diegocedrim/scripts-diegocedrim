    "body": "Before Junit 4.10 I was using TemporaryFolder API to create files and directories directly in the test without usage of @Rule annotation. Since new release the code doesn't work anymore as IllegalStateException is thrown.\n\nThe cause of the error is the fact that 2 (newFile(String) and newFolder(String...)) out of 4 methods in TemporaryFolder class call getRoot() method which checks if folder variable is not null and if it is it throws IllegalStateException.\n\nI can imagine that by design TemporaryFolder should not be used directly but only via @Rule. However then API must be symmetric in usage of getRoot(), so either all four methods should call it or none should. \n",
