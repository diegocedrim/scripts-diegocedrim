I wonder if it would be simpler to enforce that a single plugin, or ES core, does not register the same setting twice, and otherwise just enforce, similar to mappings, that the setting matches an already registered setting (so two plugins cannot try to register the same setting name with different properties).\r\n\r\nI think it's much simpler to explicitly mark the ones that can be duplicates since it has to be done on both ends... (I guess that means my code is wrong :) I should look up the already registered setting and check if its also shared. I think this would protect us from others overriding any settings on us?",
