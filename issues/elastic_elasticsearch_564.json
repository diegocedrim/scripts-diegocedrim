    "body": "Some messages sent by one node to another requires high priority (such as the ping messages to detect liveness). Others require lower priority since they include large payloads (recovery, bulk), and the rest are, well, the rest.\n\nIntroduce connection pooling between one node and another, with `high`, `low`, and `med`. By default, `high` is set to 1, `med` is set to `7`, and low is set to `2`.\n\nThis mainly comes from the problem of sending big bulk requests on the same channel causing other messages to get delayed.\n",
