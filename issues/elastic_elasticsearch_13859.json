    "body": "This change refactors the SearchRequest so it is parsed on the coordinating node and then sent as a serialised object to the shards. The SearchSourceBuilder encompasses the state of the bpdy of the search request (know in the code as source) and is embedded in the SearchRequest. On the shard the SearchSourceBuilder is used to populate the SearchContext where we used to parse the source JSON.\n\nA few things to note:\n- The Java API has been changed to only accept builders in the SearchRequest, SearchRequestBuilder, SearchSourceBuilder and other similar classes. This means that all methods that accepted BytesReference, byte[], String, BytesArray etc. in the search API (and derivatives) should have been removed\n- Some variables inside the SearchSourceBuilder are stored as BytesReference object as their builder objects have not yet been refactored. The SearchSourceBuilder converts the incoming Builder into the BytesReference to serialise to the shards and the parsing of this JSON is still handled in SearchService.parseSource(). Over time these will be refactored so these builders can also be stored as objects in SearchSourceBuilder and serialised to the shards properly.\n",
