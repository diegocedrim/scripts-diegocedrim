    "body": "When performing a \"write\" operation, allow to control if it can be performed only when `one` shard is active, a `quorum` of shards are active (within a replication group), or `all`.\n\nThis can be controlled per API call (REST parameter is `consistency` and can be set to `one`, `quorum`, or `all`. It defaults to a node level setting of `action.write_consistency` which in turn defaults to `quorum`. This basically means that the default is `quorum`.\n\nWhat does this means? Basically, in a 1 shard with 2 replicas, there will have to be at least 2 shards active (`quorum`) within the cluster for the operation to be performed.\n\nIn a 1 shard with 1 replica, at least 1 shard will need to be active (in this case `quorum` and `one` is the same).\n",
