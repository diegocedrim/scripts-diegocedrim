    "body": "Realtime GET support allows to get a document once indexed regardless of the \"refresh rate\" of the index. It is enabled by default.\n\nIn order to disable realtime GET, one can either set `realtime` parameter to `false`, or globally default it to by setting the `action.get.realtime` to `false` in the node configuration.\n# Realtime GET and stored fields\n\nWhen getting a document, one can specify `fields` to fetch from it. They will, when possible, be fetched as stored fields (fields mapped as stored in the mapping). When using realtime GET, there is no notion of stored fields (at least for a period of time, basically, until the next flush), so they will be extracted from the source itself (note, even if source is not enabled). It is a good practice to assume that the fields will be loaded from source when using realtime GET, even if the fields are stored.\n",
