    "body": "Initially, the idea was that work consisted of transient data, but, with the local gateway and the fact that indices gets reused with shared gateway, the data location (where indices are stored) is quite important.\n\nNow, the following are the paths:\n\n`path.data`: path to where data will be placed. Defaults to `ES_HOME\\data`.\n`path.logs`: path to logs location. Defaults to `ES_HOME\\logs`.\n`path.work`: path to temporary data created. Defaults to `ES_HOME\\work`.\n\nIn order to upgrade to new version, the simplest thing to do is rename `work` to `data`. If `path.work` is set to point to the data location storage, change it to `path.data`.\n",
