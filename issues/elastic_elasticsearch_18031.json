    "body": "It will keep using the caching terms enum for keyword/text fields and falls back\nto IndexSearcher.count for fields that do not use the inverted index for\nsearching (such as numbers and ip addresses). Note that this probably means that\nsignificant terms aggregations on these fields will be less efficient than they\nused to be. It should be ok under a sampler aggregation though.\n\nThis moves tests back to the state they were in before numbers started using\npoints, and also adds a new test that significant terms aggs fail if a field is\nnot indexed.\n\nIn the long term, we might want to follow the approach that Robert initially\nproposed that consists in collecting all documents from the background filter in\norder to compute frequencies using doc values. This would also mean that\nsignificant terms aggregations do not require fields to be indexed anymore.\n",
