For example, implementing tag clouds, or providing basic auto suggest search box.\n\nThere should be several options for this API, including sorting by term (lex) or doc freq, bounding size, from/to (inclusive or not), min/max freq, prefix and regexp filtering.\n\nThe rest api should be: /{index}/_terms\n",
