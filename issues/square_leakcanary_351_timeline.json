Client process binds.\r\n2. Server process Service does onCreate, onBind.\r\n3. Client process unbinds.\r\n4. Server process Service does onUnbind, onDestroy. But IBinder returned from onBind is set as a GC root, and likely holds a reference to the Service after Service.onDestroy was called, which looks like a leak.\r\n\r\nThe server process can't force the client process to do a GC, and it can't be notified when the client process has GC'ed either. Therefore the only way to not trigger false positives for LeakCanary notifications is to filter out instances of classes extending android.os.Binder as GC roots.",

If you fix the leak by commenting out the static ArrayList, it still shows up as a leak.\r\nWith Adam's change, the leak is detected by pointing all the way to the static ArrayList, and when the leak is fixed, no false alerts are generated.",

See https://github.com/square/leakcanary/commit/d28f9200d38349b6511941f796be8c354580af41 for an example test case.\r\n\r\nRevisiting the example you provided in https://github.com/dandc87/leakcanary/commit/5a293dbf8098c04adbfd4a2e13699e4a90bc0feb, it looks like the leak occurs because an anonymous subclass of Binder references the Service installed to the RefWatcher.  Consider  https://github.com/jrodbx/leakcanary/commit/c9dce97aedca03a4fee443330094e3b32175338d which doesn't result in a leak as mentioned in the [original cited Google issue](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=1797#c2).  Am I missing something?\r\n\r\nWe can continue the dialog on this, but, in the meantime, I'll revert this commit since it's causing false negatives.",
