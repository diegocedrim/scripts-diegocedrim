In other words ES says I have 1.115.857 documents in my index, but my export contains 1.049.191 documents. Testing with an index with up to 900.000 document is working fine. Somebody that can explain this behavior?\n\nES is running on a CentOS machine with 6GB of RAM with a ES_HEAP_SIZE of 3GB.\n",
