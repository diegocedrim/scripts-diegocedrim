    "body": "Please take a look at issue #645 again. The erroneous behavior described there is still present in ElasticSearch v0.19.3\n\nI ran @lukas-vlcek script and the same erroneous behavior was observed. When `\"term_vector\" : \"with_positions_offsets\"` is used in the mapping, the highlighted fields are concatenated into a single string. This behavior differs from the case where term vectors are not used.\n\nI believe one bug was fixed. In the example from #645 the extra tag string `\"two wordish\"` was included in the highlight results. This bug is fixed in the case where term vectors are **not** being used for highlighting.\n\nHowever, when term vectors are enabled and the fast-vector-highlighter is used, all the highlight tags are concatenated together into a single string.\n\n```\n{\n  \"took\" : 3,\n  \"timed_out\" : false,\n  \"_shards\" : {\n    \"total\" : 5,\n    \"successful\" : 5,\n    \"failed\" : 0\n  },\n  \"hits\" : {\n    \"total\" : 1,\n    \"max_score\" : 0.16273327,\n    \"hits\" : [ {\n      \"_index\" : \"test\",\n      \"_type\" : \"one\",\n      \"_id\" : \"hx79P59ARRaOylM6yfYH2w\",\n      \"_score\" : 0.16273327, \"_source\" : { \"tags\" : [\"one word\",\"too wordish\",\"three words\"]},\n      \"highlight\" : {\n        \"tags\" : [ \"one <em>word</em> too wordish three <em>words</em>\" ]\n      }\n    } ]\n  }\n}\n```\n",
