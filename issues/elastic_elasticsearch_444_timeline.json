Maybe, a extra durability in case of a getting killed before snapshotting? \r\n\r\nNot sure if this is completely on topic for this, but when a doc is indexed, it can never fail on one replica and succeed on another, correct? I ask, because I have been and still am seeing minor consistency issues when I test bringing nodes up and down on latest master.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
