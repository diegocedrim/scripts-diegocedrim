    "body": "Elasticsearch does not support lucene's SpanMultiTermQueryWrapper. This lucene query allows users to form complicated queries such as wildcards or prefix queries embedded within span queries. These complex queries are regularly used in certain fields (e.g., legal research) and adding support for it would open ES up to a new field.\n\nUnfortunately, adding support is not possible using a plugin because the plugin system offers no way to install new query types as plugins. All of the QueryBuilders are hard-coded in QueryBuilders.java.\n\nThis is not a bug, but a feature request to expose SpanMultiTermQueryWrapper to ES's query API.\n\nSome additional information on this feature request can be found here:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/elasticsearch/vHQh0ARaAHY\n",
