    "body": "Today, we rely on the user to set request listener threads to true when they are on the client side in order not to block the IO threads on heavy operations. This proves to be very trappy for users, and end up creating problems that are very hard to debug.\nInstead, we can do the right thing, and automatically thread listeners that are used from the client when the client is a node client or a transport client.\nThis change also removes the ability to set request level listener threading, in the effort of simplifying the code path and reasoning around when something is threaded and when it is not.\n",
