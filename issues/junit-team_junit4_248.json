    "body": "As this method is of scope `protected` in 4.8 and 4.8.1 it seems that it is (was) meant for possible overriding. Especially I use that to add from my custom `Runner` an extra `MethodRule` to the list of rules.\nThis allows users of the runner to not have to specify a rule as well and then minimise configuration.\n\nIf there is a clean work around this particular issue, I'm more than happy to hear about it. Looking at the code I couldn't find a clean and simple way to do this\u2026\n\nCan the `rules` method be added back?\n\nBTW, the code for the `ActiveObjectsJUnitRunner` I am talking about is here if that helps: http://java.net/projects/activeobjects/sources/svn/content/trunk/activeobjects-test/src/main/java/net/java/ao/test/junit/ActiveObjectsJUnitRunner.java\n\nThe actual overridding of the `rules` method:\n\n``` java\n@Override\n    protected List<MethodRule> rules(Object test)\n    {\n        final LinkedList<MethodRule> methodRules = new LinkedList<MethodRule>(super.rules(test));\n        methodRules.add(new ActiveObjectTransactionMethodRule(test, jdbcConfiguration, withIndex, tableNameConverter, fieldNameConverter));\n        return methodRules;\n    }\n```\n",
