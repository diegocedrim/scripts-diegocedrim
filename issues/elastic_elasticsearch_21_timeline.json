I would say then they should be called `from` and `until`, rather than `to`.\r\n\r\nIn Perl (and some other dynamic languages), loops can be written more succinctly, like:\r\n\r\n    for (1..5) {  }\r\n    foreach my $name (@names) \r\n\r\n... both of which are inclusive.  To my mind, basing the default values of `fromInclusive` and `toInclusive` on a `for` loop exposes implementation, rather than representing how a user might think in natural language.\r\n\r\n> Regarding the field name....\r\n\r\nOK, I have two mappings: type_1 and type_2. Both have a field 'text', but i ask for terms on field 'text' or 'type_1.text', I get the same results, which doesn't seem to be what I'm asking.\r\n\r\nIs this what it is supposed to do?\r\n\r\n",
