        "body": "Unfortunately I had no time to investigate this issue but I found a really quick and simple workaround to have \"transparent\" background for the chart.\r\n\r\nLet's say you have a screen with the background color #F6F3F1(which is 246 243 241 in RGB). In order to have a \"transparent\" background you may set the same color to the chart as well(it won't be transparent but it'll have the same color).\r\nBut if you'll set the same background color to the chart, you'll notice a small difference between the chart's and the screen's drawn background colors(this is because of the way the chart is drawn) when you run the app.\r\n\r\nThis is where the tricky part comes in:\r\n - Run your app using an emulator(Genymotion is a really good choice for personal use)\r\n - Open your chart screen and using a color reader application(for Mac users there is the DigitalColor Meter app in the Applications' Utilities folder | Windows users, you may use this tool: http://www.cosmin.com/colordetector/)\r\n - Using the ColorDetector tool, read the actual color code of your chart's background. It should be different than 246 243 241(#F6F3F1) and most probably you'll get a value like 247 243 247(at least this is what I got)\r\n\r\nNow you have two different colors but you need a proper background color for your chart. What you'll do is to mirror the values of 247 243 247 according to the original values of the screen's or the chart's root layout's background(246 243 241)\r\nLet's say we'll call:\r\n - your needed color X\r\n - your actual background color Y\r\n - the background color you red with the ColorDetector tool Z\r\nSO your needed background color for the chart(X) will be calculated as follows for the RGB's all 3 values:\r\nY + (Y - Z) = X\r\n\r\nMore straightforward:\r\nThe RED value:      246 + (246 - 247) = 245\r\nThe GREEN value: 243 + (243 - 243) = 243\r\nThe BLUE value:     241 + (241 - 247) = 235\r\n\r\nSo now you have the RGB values for your needed background color for the chart(245 243 235) which is #F5F3EB.\r\n\r\nThis is a temporary solution I came up with really quick. Other suggestions or ideas are more than welcome.\r\n\r\nHopefully this workaround will help others as well\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMike\r\n\r\n",
