    "body": "Currently, classes that are used to declare tables must have uncapitalized names. This is because the code generator generates a cursor class with the same name except that in this case it is capitalized.\n\nI don't like having to write classes with lower case names, and I fear that a lot of Java programmers are going to hate us for it.\n\nI suggest that we either:\n- Rename the cursor class from Employee to EmployeeCursor or EmployeeRow, and thereby allowing for the declaration class to be renamed from 'employee' to Employee.\n- Rename the declaration class from 'employee' to EmployeeRow, or EmployeeDecl, or EmployeeSpec.\n\nIn the latter case, the code generator would then strip off the suffix. It might even be made to recognize and strip off any of the three mentioned suffices. Since the declaration table is not actually used for anything, currently, the prettyness of its name should not matter too much.\n\nOn the other hand, the declaration class could be made to have some useful purposes, for example, we might want to allow something like the following (this assumes that the declaration class is renamed to 'Employee' and the cursor class is renamed to 'EmployeeRow'):\n\n```\npublic void insertEmployees(Set<Employee> employees)\n{\n    for (Employee employee: employees) {\n        employeeTable.add(employee);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nand\n\n```\npublic Set<Employee> extractEmployees()\n{\n    Set<Employee> employees;\n    for (EmployeeRow row: employeeTable) {\n        employees.add(row.getEmployee());\n    }\n    return employees;\n}\n```\n",
